### Package Usage using the FHIR Validator
<p>The FHIR Validator is a Java jar that is provided as part of the specification, and that is used during the publication process to validate all the published examples.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/validation.html#jar" target="_blank">Follow this link for the full description on the usage of this validator</a></p>
<p>As example: This is the command line to validate FHIR resources located in the folder "c:\temp\MCNExamples" and the output HTML file will be available in "c:\temp\validation.html". </p>
<p>Note: As no version is indicated, the validation will be done with the latest published MyCareNet Package.</p>
